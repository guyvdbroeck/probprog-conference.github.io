# Call for Submissions

- **Original Deadline**: <span style="color:red"><strike>Jan 10, 2020 11:59 PM AOE</strike></span> 
- **Late-breaking Deadline**: <span style="color:red">Aug 7, 2020 11:59 PM AOE 
- **Submit at**: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PROBPROG2020](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PROBPROG2020/)
- **Style Files**: [ZIP](/2020/probprog-2020-style.zip)
- **Overview and Call for Submission**: [PDF](/2020/progprog-2020-submission-guidelines.pdf)

The PROBPROG 2020 conference is seeking two kinds of submissions:

1. **Extended Abstracts**: Authors may submit work in the form of an
extended abstract of 2-6 pages for consideration for a poster
presentation, talk, or full-length proceedings submission. Extended
abstracts are intended as a mechanism for discussing work that may be
preliminary, and for this reason are non-archival. Titles for accepted
poster presentations and talks will be listed on the conference
website. Our aim is to enable researchers to get feedback from the
PROBPROG community that helps mature the research, strengthen the
probabilistic programming content, and improve the chances of
acceptance in top venues aligned with other fields.

2. **Syndicated Submissions**: Authors may submit work that has been
accepted for publication in another venue within the last 12 months
for consideration as a poster presentation or talk. These submissions
may be full-length and are also non-archival, but will be listed on
the conference website.

Authors should indicate if they would like their submission to be
considered for invitation by the online Probabilistic Programming
journal.

# Late-breaking Submissions

Owing to the fact that there is a 5-month gap between the original conference dates (Apr 23 - 25) and the rescheduled dates (Oct 22 - 24), we would like to invite authors who did not have a chance to submit in January to do so in August. 

- Authors of submissions that were accepted in the previous cycle do not need to resubmit this cycle.

- We encourage authors of extended abstracts that were not accepted to resubmit an updated abstract this Fall. 

- In cases where authors wish to be considered for the online journal, the may elect to send us an updated abstract.

# Online Probabilistic Programming Journal

PROBPROG is a cross-disciplinary venue that aims to balance three goals:

Probabilistic programming conference papers are often accepted at top
research conferences, e.g. NeurIPS, AISTATS, ICML, UAI, PLDI, and
POPL. However, there is no existing venue for longer (10-25 page)
papers, that may require detailed reviews by experts from multiple
fields. In addition to novel contributions in the general domain of
probabilistic programming, such papers may **(i)** present unifying
perspectives on larger research directions in probabilistic
programming; **(ii)** present key design insights and implementation
details of important probabilistic programming systems; or **(iii)**
present in-depth tutorials on techniques and applications that could
be important to practitioners.

Probabilistic Programming is a new online journal, published
concurrently with the PROBPROG conference. Probabilistic Programming
aims to foster the development of probabilistic programming as an
intellectual activity, and educate the growing community of
probabilistic programming researchers and practitioners. This year, a
subset of PROBPROG abstracts will be invited to be expanded into
articles in the inaugural issue of Probabilistic
Programming. Submissions should indicate if they would like to be
considered for these invitations.
